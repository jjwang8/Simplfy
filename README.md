# Simplfy
A project for the software engineering club in uw madison

Install transformers: 
pip install transformers
Install pytorch if you don't have
Install other libaries if needed like pandas, numpy

On google colab you need to enable gpus, runtime > change runtime type > hardware accelerator > gpu

//end goal: create a chrome extension that can summarize web pages, 
      //highlight different important sentences,
      //find similar articles to the article that you let your mouse hover over (on Google's search results)
      
//now: fine tune one model, fine tune many different models, and compare efficiencies
      //train the model to categorize the article based on genre
      
//later: use NLP to read content on webpages and be able to summarize Wikipedia articles --> Reddit threads

***Note: This project is a work in progress but there will be files added to the repository soon, once we get a base model functioning!***
